// At this checkpoint you are asked to write an algorithm that fulfills the following description:

// Description:

//     Problem 1
     
//     Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set. In other words, find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.
//     Example:
//     Set 1 : [3, 1, 7, 9], Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
//     Output: 13 (distinct elements 4, 7, 2 )
//     Give a solutions to this problem, using arrays

     




// We consider three integer variables x, y and z.
// We define the circular permutation between x, y and z as the operation which gives x the  value of y, at y the value of z and at z the value of x.
// Write an algorithm allowing circular permutation between x, y and z. The algorithm should read  the 3 values then display them after permutations.
// Example: if x = 3 y = -1 and z = 7, we will have after permutations: x = -1, y = 7 and z = 3.

//GET vairable X =  17
//Get variable Y  =  23
//Get variable Z =  33
//LET X = Y
//LET Y = Z
//LET Z = X;
//CONSOLE.LOG(X)
//CONSOLE.LOG(Y)
