// A date is given as an integer of 6 digits. For example, the number 181019 represents October 18, 2019.
// Develop an algorithm that has such a number as input, checks that this number corresponds to a valid date and displays the following result:
// Day: 18
// Month: October
// Year: 2019

//take in the 6 digit integer date as an  input
//check if the date comprises of only integers
//if not, throw an error - Date is not valid
//check if the date is 6 digits
//if not, throw an error - Date is not valid
//if the first 2 digits is greater than 31 or if the first two is less than 01, throw an error - Date is not valid
//if the 3rd and 4th digit put together is less that 01 or greater tahn 12, throw an error -date is invalid
//if th 5th and 6th digit put together is less than 00 or greater than 99, throw an error - date is invalid
//if the 3rd and 4th number is 04, 10, 06, 11 and the first two is greater 30, throw an error -date is invalid
//if the 3rd and 4th number is 02, and the first two number is greater 28days, throw an error
//if the last two is divisible by 4, and the 3rd and 4th is 02, and the first two is greater 29days, throw an error - invalid year
